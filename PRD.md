# Product Requirement Document (PRD)

## 1. Product Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a modern, user-friendly website for a local football club. The website will serve as the club's digital hub, providing information about teams, membership, sponsorship opportunities, and events. It will also enhance engagement with fans, players, and sponsors by integrating multimedia content such as match videos.

The website will be coded in English, but all user-facing text must be in German to ensure accessibility for the clubâ€™s community. The platform will be responsive, ensuring an optimal experience across desktop and mobile devices.

Key Objectives:

- Clear navigation & structure: Organize content logically for easy access.
- User-friendly design: Ensure a smooth experience for all visitors.
- Multimedia integration: Embed match videos and other dynamic content.
- Sponsorship promotion: Highlight sponsorship opportunities effectively.
- Scalability: Allow for future expansions, such as additional sports or club activities.
